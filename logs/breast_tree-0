Significant amount of unused dabits of replicated Z2^64. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 64.8476 seconds 
Data sent = 3725.19 MB in ~468581 rounds (party 0; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 11175.3 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'breast_tree.mpc':
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_split(3)
